     HOW TO USE THIS FILE

     This is your submission. Fill each section in as you finish the milestone
     it belongs to — don't leave it all to the end.

     Unit 3 asks for the first five sections. Unit 4 adds the five below them.
     Leave the unit 4 sections alone until then; they're here so you know
     what's coming.

     Everything is pasted as TEXT. No screenshots, no images, no video links.
     A typed block of output gets full credit; a picture of the same output
     gets none.

## What This Does

<!-- Three or four sentences: what a user asks for, and what they get back. -->

1) search_listings(description, size, max_price)

+ Purpose: 
     = Searches and returns a listing based on the description, optionally can include size and max price of item as well. Only function that doesn't call the model.

+ Input: 
     = description --> str 
     = size --> str | None 
     = max_price --> float | None 

+ Returns: 
     = List --> dictionaries with matching listings, best match first. 
          + Key is the field name
          + Value are field values
     = If size and max_price are not given, then the best match should be an item with keywords in its description that best matches the description input. 
     = Else, if size and max_price is given, then the best match listing should have a description that shares keywords with the input descritpion, as well as having the closest corresponding sizes and max price (prioritize prices, and if prices are not close, then prioritize choosing best listing based on size.)

     Ex Listing: 

          {
          "id": "lst_002",
          "title": "Y2K Baby Tee — Butterfly Print",
          "description": "Super cute early 2000s baby tee with butterfly graphic. Fitted crop length. Tag says medium but fits like a small.",
          "category": "tops",
          "style_tags": ["y2k", "vintage", "graphic tee", "cottagecore"],
          "size": "S/M",
          "condition": "excellent",
          "price": 18.00,
          "colors": ["white", "pink", "purple"],
          "brand": null,
          "platform": "depop"
          }


+ If Empty...: 
     = Returns an empty list


2) suggest_outfit(new_item, wardrobe)

+ Purpose: 
     = Recommends one or two outfits given the user's wardrobe and thrifted item. Does call the model through generate(). 

+ Input: 
     = new_item --> listing dict
          + Key: Id or Title 
          + Value: Rest of the fields 
     = wardrobe --> wardrobe dict | Empty dict
          + Key: Items key
          + Value: A list of items
     
     Ex Wardrobe: 
          {
          "items": [
          {
               "id": "w_001",
               "name": "Baggy straight-leg jeans, dark wash",
               "category": "bottoms",
               "colors": ["dark blue", "indigo"],
               "style_tags": ["denim", "streetwear", "baggy"],
               "notes": "High-waisted, sits above the hip"
          },
          {
               "id": "w_003",
               "name": "White ribbed tank top",
               "category": "tops",
               "colors": ["white"],
               "style_tags": ["basics", "minimal", "fitted"],
               "notes": "Goes with everything"
          },
          {
               "id": "w_007",
               "name": "Chunky white sneakers",
               "category": "shoes",
               "colors": ["white"],
               "style_tags": ["sneakers", "chunky", "streetwear"],
               "notes": null
          }
          ]
          }


+ Returns: 
     = string with outfit suggestions 

+ If Empty...: 
     = Will just return general outfit advice


3) create_fit_card(outfit, new_item)

+ Purpose: 
     = Returns a description that people can post about the fit recommended

+ Input: 
     = outfit --> str
     = new_item --> listing dict  

+ Returns: 
     = two to four sentence caption or description about the outfit

+ If Empty...: 
     = Will still return a general description.
---

Additional Rules (Branch Loop): 
+ If search_listings returns an empty list: 
     a) Instead of raising a session["error"], the system sets to session["notice"] and recommends a description "let's try something like 'leather boots'" to the user instead, then returning the session. That way the user can either use the recommended search or refine their original description to get a non-empty list.
     
+ If search_listings returns with a non-empty list: 
     a) The non-empty list gets automatically inputted into suggest_outfit.

+ NOTE: Both scenarios call agent.py::run_agent.

## Tool Inventory

<!-- Four lines per tool. This is worth 2 points and it's the single most
     common place students lose them.

     "Returns a list" earns NOTHING. The description has to say what is IN
     the list.

     The empty case isn't optional either — it's the thing your loop branches
     on, and if you don't decide it here you'll discover it as a crash in
     Milestone 5. -->

### `search_listings`

- **What it does:**
- **Inputs:** <!-- name and type each: `max_price` (float), not "a price" -->
- **Returns:**
- **When it has nothing:**

### `suggest_outfit`

- **What it does:**
- **Inputs:**
- **Returns:**
- **When it has nothing:**

### `create_fit_card`

- **What it does:**
- **Inputs:**
- **Returns:**
- **When it has nothing:**

## Planning Loop

<!-- Your branch rule, stated as a rule — the condition AND both paths — plus
     the file and function that holds it.

     Like this:
       "If search_listings returns an empty list, put a message in the session
        and stop. Otherwise take the first result and go to suggest_outfit."
        — agent.py::run_agent

     The grader checks your code against what you claim here, so the file and
     function have to be real. -->

**Branch rule:**

**Where it lives:** `agent.py::run_agent`

**How the query is parsed:** <!-- regex, string splitting, or asking the model — say which -->

**What moves through the session:** <!-- which fields, in what order -->

---

## Sample Run

<!-- Two things go here.

     1. One FULL query and its output, pasted as text.
     2. Your three per-tool terminal tests — the command and what it printed. -->

**One full query**

```
$ python app.py ask '...'

```

**The three tools, tested one at a time**

```
$ python -c "from tools import search_listings; print(search_listings('graphic tee', max_price=30))"

```

```
$ python -c "from tools import suggest_outfit; ..."

```

```
$ python -c "from tools import create_fit_card; ..."

```

## How I Used AI

<!-- Two specific moments. What you asked, what came back, what you changed.

     "I used Claude to help me code" is not enough.

     "I gave Claude my search_listings spec. It returned None on no match
     instead of an empty list, so I changed it" is the level we want. -->

**Moment 1**

- *What I asked for:*
- *What came back:*
- *What I changed:*

**Moment 2**

- *What I asked for:*
- *What came back:*
- *What I changed:*

<!-- ═══════════════════════ UNIT 4 — THE TEST ═══════════════════════

     Don't fill these in during unit 3.
     ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->

## Run Log — Before

<!-- Five criteria, five tries each, in this exact format.

     Five, because your criteria are written out of five. Mark each try PASS
     or FAIL, count the passes, and read that count against your target — a
     row targeting 4 of 5 with three PASS cells is MISSED (3/5).

     `python run_eval.py --label before` runs everything and writes the table
     into results/. Paste it here and fill in the verdicts. -->

| Criterion | Target | Try 1 | Try 2 | Try 3 | Try 4 | Try 5 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 5.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

**Real output from one try**, pasted as text, naming the file and function
that produced it:

```

## Verdicts and Diagnoses

<!-- MET or MISSED per criterion against LAST UNIT's target, plus a sentence on
     how you decided.

     Then, for every miss: which of the four places it happened — a tool, the
     loop's branch, the session, or the model's output — AND the mechanism.

     Not a diagnosis:  "The fit card was bad."
     A diagnosis:      "The fit card criterion missed on 2 of 5 items. Both had
                        an empty brand field. My prompt puts the brand in the
                        first sentence, so the card opened with a blank and read
                        like a fragment. The tool worked; the prompt assumed a
                        field that isn't always there."

     Look for a pattern. Three misses on the same tool is one problem, not
     three. -->

| # | Criterion | Target | Verdict | How I decided |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |  |

**Diagnoses**

## Loop Trace

<!-- One full run, printed step by step, with the MCP call visible in it.

     `python app.py ask '...' --trace` once you've added the trace.step()
     calls in Milestone 2.

     Worth pasting BOTH the happy path and the empty-search path. The empty
     one should be visibly shorter, because it stops. If your two traces are
     the same length, your branch isn't working — and this is the fastest way
     anyone will ever find that out. -->

**Happy path**

```

```

**Empty search**

```

```

**On the MCP move:** <!-- what changed in your code, and whether anything
behaved differently afterwards. If the rewire didn't work, say exactly where it
broke — the error text and the last thing that worked. That earns the point in
full. -->



---

## The Improvement

<!-- What you changed, why your diagnosis pointed at it, and the after-run in
     the same table format. One change, measured properly.

     `python run_eval.py --label after` -->

**What I changed:**

**Which failure it was meant to fix:**

### Run Log — After

| Criterion | Target | Try 1 | Try 2 | Try 3 | Try 4 | Try 5 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 5.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

**Did it help, and how do I know:**

<!-- If it made things worse, say that. Honestly reported, that earns full
     credit and is more interesting than one that worked. -->



---

## What's Still Broken

<!-- For each criterion still missed: what you'd do, and why you stopped where
     you did. "I ran out of time" is fine if it's true. Pretending nothing is
     left is not. -->
